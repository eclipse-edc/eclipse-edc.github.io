# Lychee Ignore Patterns

This file (`.lycheeignore`) contains regex patterns for URLs that should be ignored by the [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) link checker when running in the GitHub Actions workflows.

## Purpose

The ignore patterns serve several purposes:

1. **Reduce false positives** - Especially for Hugo-generated sites where relative links that work in production might look broken during checks
2. **Improve performance** - By excluding links that are known to be valid or not important to check
3. **Avoid rate limiting** - By excluding frequent API endpoints that might trigger rate limits

## Pattern Categories

The patterns in `.lycheeignore` are organized into these categories:

1. **Example domains** - Standard placeholder URLs
2. **Development URLs** - Local development links (localhost, etc.)
3. **Social media links** - Often have anti-scraping measures
4. **Restricted files** - Files that may require authentication
5. **Local file paths** - Paths that exist in production but not in CI
6. **GitHub patterns** - To reduce API rate limiting issues
7. **Hugo-specific patterns** - To handle Hugo path differences
8. **Protocol-specific links** - Special protocols like mailto, slack, etc.
9. **Project-specific patterns** - Custom patterns for this project

## Adding New Patterns

When adding new patterns:

1. Be specific to avoid excluding important links
2. Test patterns with the `lychee` CLI tool when possible
3. Add a comment explaining non-obvious patterns
4. Organize patterns in the appropriate category

## Common Pattern Syntax

- `^` - Start of the URL
- `$` - End of the URL
- `\.` - Literal dot (escaped)
- `.*` - Any character, any number of times
- `[^/]+` - One or more characters that are not a slash
- `(pattern1|pattern2)` - Either pattern1 or pattern2

## Examples

- `^https?://example\.com` - Ignores all HTTP and HTTPS URLs to example.com
- `\.pdf$` - Ignores all PDF file links
- `^mailto:.*` - Ignores all mailto links
