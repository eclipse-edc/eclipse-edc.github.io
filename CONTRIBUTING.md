# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Eclipse Contributor Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by an Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA).
You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#specifications-contributors> to understand
how to sign the ECA.

You generally only need to submit the ECA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Contribution Guidelines

Head over to the [Eclipse EDC Documentation](https://eclipse-edc.github.io/documentation/for-contributors/guidelines/) to understand the contribution guidelines.
