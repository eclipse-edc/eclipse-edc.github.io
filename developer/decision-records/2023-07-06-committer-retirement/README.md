# Adding guidelines for Committers retirement

## Decision
[Committer of the EDC](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.edc/who) project have a higher activity requirement, as they directly impact the ability of others to contribute. Therefore, *Committers* with an extended period away from the project with no activity will be retired from their role of *Committer* in the EDC and will be required to go through the meritocratic process again after re-familiarizing themselves with the current state.

Inactive *Committers* are defined as members of the EDC *Committers* with no contributions across any repository within 6 months (according to EFâ€™s suggestion), or recognizable non-code contributions to the project. *Committers* are expected to regularly attend *Committer-Meetings*.

NB: The EF tool does not consider non-code contributions. If a non-code contributing member is accidentally removed this way, they may open an issue to quickly be re-instated.

## Rationale

According to the [Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#roles-cm), *Committers* are the ones who hold the keys. *Committers* are either appointed at the time of project creation, or elected by the existing project team.  They decide what code goes into the code base, decide how a project builds, and they ultimately decide what gets delivered to the adopter community. With awesome power, comes awesome responsibility, and so the Open Source Rules of Engagement described by the Eclipse Foundation Development Process, puts meritocracy on equal footing with transparency and openness:

> being a *Committers* does require a demonstration of merit.

Some *Committers* may not be able to continue contributing actively in the project for a variety of reasons. A statement on how a retirement of these *Committers* is handled in the EDC project is missing to the point.

## Approach

- Evaluation and initiating the retirement process of *Committers* is done by the EDC *Committers'* Roundtable on a regular basis
- Evaluation criteria based on code and non-code contributions are described in [COMMITTERS.md](../../../COMMITTERS.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
- The retirement process is started for identified inactive *Committers* for an initial clean-up after the decision-record is accepted
