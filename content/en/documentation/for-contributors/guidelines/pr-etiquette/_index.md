## Choosing an area to work on

We welcome all contributions, after all, they are what keep the project alive and active. However, there are a few
important things to note for a successful contribution. Choosing an area to work on is a key aspect for a
successful pull request.

As with any other open-source project, it is generally good practice to start out with some relatively low-impact
contributions like documentation, fixing some minor bugs or generally issues with `good first issue` label on them.
That way we (the committers) get to know you, we can build trust, and you'll get to know the code base better.

It is **not recommended** to start your journey with high-impact contributions such as changes to core modules, changes
that cut across several modules or that generally bring a very large changeset. Start small, work your way in from
there.

Most importantly, it is **always** required to open a discussion or an issue first.

## Before opening a pull request

Pull requests **must** be linked to an issue that has already gone through the triage process. In most cases, the
general triage process looks like this:

- open a discussion, wait for comments
- committers comment and possibly convert the discussion to an issue labelled with `triage`
- you might be asked to provide more details or even a solution proposal in the issue
- issue triage happens, at which point the `triage` label is removed
- now the issue is ready for implementation

Issues from external contributors, i.e. contributors that aren't committers, require a _sponsor_. A sponsor is a
committer who will provide technical guidance and work with you on a solution proposal and who will represent the
feature in the technical committee. Sponsors should also be put on as reviewers to the pull request, although they might
request a second review from another committer (four eyes principle).

Sponsorship can be obtained through engagement on discussions or issues.


> Pull requests, that are not linked to a properly triaged issue might be ignored or get closed without notice,
> regardless of the author or the content!

## For PR Authors

PRs should adhere to the following rules.

- Familiarize yourself with [coding style](./styleguide.md), [./architectural patterns](coding-principles.md),
  and other contribution guidelines.
- No surprise PRs. Before submitting a PR, open a discussion or an issue outlining the planned work and give
  people time to comment. Unsolicited PRs may get ignored or rejected.
- Create focused PRs. Work should be focused on one particular feature or bug. Do not create broad-scoped PRs that
  solve multiple issues or span signficant portions of the codebase as they will be rejected outright.
- Provide a clear PR description and motivation. This makes the reviewer's life much
  easier. It is also helpful to outline the broad changes that were made, e.g. "Changes the schema of XYZ-Entity:
  the `age` field changed from `long` to `String`".
- If 3rd party dependencies are introduced, note them in the PR description and explain why they are necessary.
- Stick to the established code style, please refer to
  the [styleguide document](./styleguide.md).
- All tests should be green, especially when your PR is in `"Ready for review"`
- Mark PRs as `"Ready for review"` only when the PR is complete. No additional commits should be pushed other than to
  incorporate review comments.
- Merge conflicts should be resolved by squashing all commits on the PR branch, rebasing onto `main,` and
  force-pushing. Do this when your PR is ready to review.
- If you require a reviewer's input while it's still in draft, please contact the designated reviewer using
  the `@mention` feature and let them know what you'd like them to look at.
- Request a review from one of the [technical committers](pr_etiquette.md#the-technical-committers). Requesting a review
  from anyone else is still possible, and sometimes may be advisable, but only committers can merge PRs, so be sure to
  include them early on.
- Re-request reviews after all remarks have been adopted. This helps reviewers track their work in GitHub. Failing to do
  that might cause your PR to stale out.
- Carefully read all review comments and be sure to incorporate them. It is very exhausting for reviewers to have to
  repeat themselves, and it might be grounds for them to close the PR.
- If you disagree with a committer's remarks, feel free to object and argue, but if no agreement is reached, you'll have
  to either accept the committer's decision or withdraw your PR. Reviewers may also close the PR if they feel their
  directions aren't followed.
- Be civil and objective. No foul language, insulting or otherwise abusive language will be tolerated.
- The PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
    - The title must follow the format as `<type>(<optional scope>): <description>`.
      `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test` are allowed for the
      `<type>`.
    - The length must be kept under 80 characters.
    -
  See [check-pull-request-title job of GitHub workflow](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/.github/blob/main/.github/workflows/scan-pull-request.yml)
  for checking details.

## For PR Reviewers

- Please complete reviews within two business days or delegate to another committer, removing yourself as a reviewer.
- If you have been requested as reviewer, but cannot do the review for any reason (time, lack of knowledge in particular
  area, etc.) please comment that in the PR and remove yourself as a reviewer, suggesting a stand-in. The **CODEOWNERS**
  document should help with that.
- Don't be overly pedantic.
- Don't argue basic principles (code style, architectural decisions, etc.)
- Use the `suggestion` feature of GitHub for small/simple changes.
- The following could serve you as a review checklist:
    - No unnecessary dependencies in `build.gradle.kts`
    - Sensible unit tests, prefer unit tests over integration tests wherever possible (test runtime). Also check the
      usage of test tags.
    - Code style
    - Simplicity and "uncluttered-ness" of the code
    - Overall focus of the PR
- Don't just wave through any PR. Please take the time to look at them carefully.
- Be civil and objective. No foul language, insulting or otherwise abusive language will be tolerated. The goal is to
  _encourage_ contributions.
